# Job_serach_engine_using_flask
I've made this project using the Flask library of python. This simple project uses a the nyc_jobs.csv dataset and you can search of jobs on and save your job preferences on it and based on those preferences it recommends you jobs as well. It was a simple project which i made for my end Sem.
